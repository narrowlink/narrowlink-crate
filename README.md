## Note: This crate does not contain any code.
Narrowlink comprises multiple crates, making it impractical to publish them all within a single repository. Therefore, we've opted to create this crate as an index for all the others. You can locate the source code and details of each individual crate at the following address:
- **Gateway**: [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/narrowlink-gateway) | [github](https://github.com/narrowlink/narrowlink/tree/main/gateway)
- **Agent**: [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/narrowlink-agent) | [github](https://github.com/narrowlink/narrowlink/tree/main/agent)
- **Client**: [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/narrowlink-client) | [github](https://github.com/narrowlink/narrowlink/tree/main/client)
- **Token Generator**: [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/narrowlink-token-generator) | [github](https://github.com/narrowlink/narrowlink/tree/main/client)

You can also install all the components of Narrowlink using the following command:

```bash
cargo install narrowlink-gateway narrowlink-agent narrowlink-client narrowlink-token-generator

# Narrowlink
<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/narrowlink/homepage/main/static/img/NarrowLink-888.svg" alt="Narrowlink Logo" width="50%"></p>
Narrowlink is a self-hosted platform that allows you to establish secure remote connections between devices within a network that may be hindered by network address translation (NAT) or firewalls. Whether you need to access a home computer from your laptop, share internet access with remote devices, or publish a local web server on the internet, Narrowlink provides the solution.


## Use Cases

-   **Port Forwarding without a Public IP Address:** Access devices within your home network from external locations without public IP addresses.
    
-   **Sharing Internet Access:** Enable remote devices to access the internet through your network.
    
-   **Publishing Your Local Webserver:** Make your local webserver accessible on the internet, even without a public IP address.
    

## Key Features

-   **Covert Communications:** Narrowlink disguises traffic as regular web browsing using the WebSocket over HTTP/S protocol, enhancing privacy and bypassing firewalls.
    
-   **Fine-Grained Access Control:** Control access to agents and services based on IP addresses, domains, and agent names, allowing you to implement zero trust network access (ZTNA) policies.
    
-   **End-to-End Encryption:** Secure your communications with end-to-end encryption using the Xchacha20-Poly1305 cipher and HMAC-SHA256 for tamper-proofing.
    
-   **User Management:** Create different user spaces with individual access control policies, providing services to multiple users with a single gateway.
    
-   **Automatic Certificate Management:** Automatic generation and management of TLS certificates for published services using the ACME protocol.
    
-   **SNI Proxy:** Prevent the gateway from decrypting your TLS traffic by handling it on the agent's server with your certificate.
    
-   **CDN Compatibility:** Set up the gateway behind CDN services to enhance the performance of your services.
    
-   **Flexibility:** Orchestrate Narrowlink with other tools like SSH or sing-box to add more functionalities.
    
-   **Cross-Platform and Lightweight:** Written in Rust, Narrowlink is lightweight, fast, and cross-platform, supporting major desktop and mobile operating systems.
    
## Architecture

Narrowlink's architecture consists of three main components: the Gateway, Agents, and Clients. The Gateway serves as the central hub, routing packets between agents, clients, and browsers. Agents act as proxies, forwarding packets to or from targeted hosts within the local network. Clients send and receive packets to and from agents, facilitating communication with the Agent component. The Token Generator is responsible for generating tokens used for authentication and configuration within the Narrowlink network.
